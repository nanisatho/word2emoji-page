            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>How does Word2Emoji work?</h3>
            <p>Word2Emoji uses artificial intelligence (Google Gemini AI) to convert your text input into emoji representations. Simply enter text, and the App will generate multiple emoji options for you to choose from.</p>
            
            <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
            <p>Your conversion history is stored locally on your device. However, your text input is sent to Google Gemini AI for processing. Please review our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for detailed information about data collection and usage.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I delete my history?</h3>
            <p>Yes! You can delete individual history items or clear all history through the App's history feature. Your data is stored locally on your device, so you have full control over it.</p>
            
            <h3>Why do I need an internet connection?</h3>
            <p>Word2Emoji requires an internet connection because it uses Google Gemini AI to generate emoji suggestions. The App makes network calls to process your text input and return emoji options.</p>
            
            <h3>What if the App isn't working?</h3>
            <p>If you're experiencing issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check your internet connection</li>
                <li>Ensure you haven't exceeded the rate limit (try again after a few minutes)</li>
                <li>Restart the App</li>
                <li>If problems persist, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@fiorellamille.com">support@fiorellamille.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Are there any age restrictions?</h3>
            <p>Word2Emoji is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. Users under 13 should use the App with parental supervision.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I use the generated emojis commercially?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you may use the emoji suggestions generated by the App for personal or commercial purposes. However, please review our <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a> for complete details.</p>
            
            <h3>How accurate are the emoji suggestions?</h3>
            <p>The emoji suggestions are generated by AI and may vary in accuracy and appropriateness. We provide multiple options so you can choose the most suitable emoji for your needs. Please review suggestions before use.</p>
