            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>How does Word2Emoji work?</h3>
            <p>Word2Emoji uses artificial intelligence (Google Gemini AI) to convert your text input into emoji representations. Simply enter text, and the App will generate multiple emoji options for you to choose from.</p>
            
            <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
            <p>Your conversion history is stored locally on your device. However, your text input is sent to Google Gemini AI for processing. Please review our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for detailed information about data collection and usage.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I delete my history?</h3>
            <p>Yes! You can delete individual history items or clear all history through the App's history feature. Your data is stored locally on your device, so you have full control over it.</p>
            
            <h3>Why do I need an internet connection?</h3>
            <p>Word2Emoji requires an internet connection because it uses Google Gemini AI to generate emoji suggestions. The App makes network calls to process your text input and return emoji options.</p>
            
            <h3>What if the App isn't working?</h3>
            <p>If you're experiencing issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check your internet connection</li>
                <li>Ensure you haven't exceeded the rate limit (try again after a few minutes)</li>
                <li>Restart the App</li>
                <li>If problems persist, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@fiorellamille.com">support@fiorellamille.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Are there any age restrictions?</h3>
            <p>Word2Emoji is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. Users under 13 should use the App with parental supervision.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I use the generated emojis commercially?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you may use the emoji suggestions generated by the App for personal or commercial purposes. However, please review our <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a> for complete details.</p>
            
            <h3>How accurate are the emoji suggestions?</h3>
            <p>The emoji suggestions are generated by AI and may vary in accuracy and appropriateness. We provide multiple options so you can choose the most suitable emoji for your needs. Please review suggestions before use.</p>
            
            <h3>Why was my content blocked?</h3>
            <p>Word2Emoji implements content filtering to maintain a safe and appropriate service. Content filtering is primarily performed by Google Gemini AI's built-in safety filters, which we configure to block inappropriate content. Your input may be blocked if it violates our content policy, which restricts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Harassment or threatening content</li>
                <li>Hate speech or discriminatory content</li>
                <li>Sexually explicit content</li>
                <li>Content promoting violence, self-harm, or illegal activities</li>
                <li>Attempts to manipulate or exploit the AI system</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> We are not responsible for content that Gemini's safety filters do not catch. You should always review AI-generated content before use. If you receive a message that your content violates our content policy, please try different words or phrases. The App also enforces input length limits and validates input on our backend to prevent abuse.</p>
            <p>Additionally, requests that exceed processing time limits will be terminated. API requests have a 30-second timeout for AI processing, and overall function execution has a 60-second timeout limit. If your request times out, you'll receive an error message and can try again. For more information, please review our <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
            
            <h3>What happens if my request times out?</h3>
            <p>Word2Emoji has built-in timeout limits to ensure responsive service and prevent requests from hanging indefinitely. If your request exceeds these limits, it will be automatically terminated:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>API Processing Timeout:</strong> 30 seconds for AI processing by Google Gemini AI</li>
                <li><strong>Overall Function Timeout:</strong> 60 seconds for the complete request processing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your request times out, you'll receive an error message indicating that the service is temporarily unavailable. This can happen if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The AI processing takes longer than expected</li>
                <li>There are network connectivity issues</li>
                <li>The service is experiencing high load</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you encounter a timeout error, please try again. Most requests complete well within the timeout limits. If you consistently experience timeout errors, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@fiorellamille.com">support@fiorellamille.com</a>.</p>
