            <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
            
            <h3>3.1 Local Storage</h3>
            <p>Your conversion history (text input, emoji results, and timestamps) is stored locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults. This data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers</li>
                <li>May be included in your device's iCloud backup if you have iCloud Backup enabled</li>
                <li>Can be deleted at any time through the App's history feature</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3.2 Cloud Storage</h3>
            <p>We use Firebase services for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Functions:</strong> Processing your text input and generating emoji suggestions using Google Gemini AI (gemini-2.0-flash-lite model)</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase App Check:</strong> Verifying that requests come from authenticated, unmodified app instances to prevent abuse and unauthorized access</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase Firestore:</strong> Storing rate limiting data (request counts and timestamps) to enforce fair usage limits</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Understanding how the App is used (if enabled)</li>
                <li><strong>Error Logging:</strong> Collecting crash reports and error information to improve the App</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Content filtering is performed by Google Gemini AI's built-in safety filters, which we configure to block inappropriate content. Content is filtered across four specific harm categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Harassment:</strong> Content that harasses, intimidates, or threatens others</li>
                <li><strong>Hate Speech:</strong> Content that promotes hatred, discrimination, or violence against individuals or groups</li>
                <li><strong>Sexually Explicit Content:</strong> Content that is sexually explicit or pornographic</li>
                <li><strong>Dangerous Content:</strong> Content that promotes violence, self-harm, or illegal activities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Google Gemini AI's safety filters are configured to block content with LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH probability of harm in these categories. Content that violates these policies will be rejected, and you will receive an error message indicating that the content violates our content policy.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            
            <h3>4.1 Google Gemini AI</h3>
            <p>To generate emoji suggestions, we send your text input to Google's Gemini AI service. When you use Word2Emoji:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your text input is transmitted to Google's servers for processing</li>
                <li>Google's AI service analyzes your text and generates emoji suggestions</li>
                <li>Google may process and store your text input according to their privacy practices</li>

            <h3>4.3 Google AdMob (Advertising)</h3>
            <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements in the App. AdMob is a service provided by Google that helps us monetize the App while keeping it free for users.</p>
            
            <h4>4.3.1 App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</h4>
            <p>On iOS 14.5 and later, we request permission to track your activity across apps and websites for advertising purposes using Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. When you first launch the App, you will see a system prompt asking:</p>
            <p><em>"We use this to show you personalized ads and improve your experience."</em></p>
            <p>You can choose to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Allow:</strong> We may use your advertising identifier (IDFA) to show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across apps and websites.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask App Not to Track:</strong> We will show you non-personalized ads that are not based on your interests or activity. The App will continue to function normally, and ads will still be displayed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your choice is stored on your device and can be changed at any time in your iOS Settings under Privacy & Security → Tracking.</p>
            
            <h4>4.3.2 Personalized vs Non-Personalized Ads</h4>
            <p>Depending on your tracking permission choice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If you allow tracking:</strong> We may use your advertising identifier (IDFA) to show you personalized ads. AdMob may collect information about your device and app usage to deliver relevant advertisements.</li>
                <li><strong>If you deny tracking:</strong> We will show you non-personalized ads. These ads are not based on your interests, browsing history, or activity across apps. AdMob may still collect limited information necessary to serve ads (such as your device type and general location), but this information is not used to create a profile about you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Regardless of your tracking choice, ads will continue to be displayed in the App. We respect your privacy choice and will not use tracking information if you choose to deny permission.</p>
            
            <h4>4.3.3 AdMob Data Collection</h4>

                <li>Device information (model, operating system, language)</li>
                <li>General location (country/region level)</li>
                <li>App usage data related to ad interactions</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Serve relevant advertisements</li>
                <li>Measure ad performance and effectiveness</li>
                <li>Prevent fraud and abuse</li>
                <li>Comply with advertising regulations</li>
