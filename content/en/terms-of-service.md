# Terms of Service

<p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 20, 2025</p>

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Emojify Text mobile application (the "App") operated by Nathalia Thomas @ Inventa Labs 💡 ("we," "our," or "us").

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the App.

## 2. Description of Service

Emojify Text is a mobile application that:

- Converts text input into emoji representations (up to 1,000 characters per input)
- Uses artificial intelligence (specifically Google Gemini AI gemini-2.0-flash-lite model) to generate emoji suggestions
- Provides up to 5 emoji options for each text input (configurable from 1 to 5)
- Stores your conversion history locally on your device (limited to the 100 most recent conversions)
- Supports multiple languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, and Chinese (Simplified)

## 3. AI-Generated Content

### 3.1 Nature of AI Content

The emoji suggestions provided by Emojify Text are generated by artificial intelligence (Google Gemini AI). You understand and agree that:

- Emoji suggestions are AI-generated and may not always be accurate or appropriate
- AI-generated content may vary for the same input
- We do not guarantee the accuracy, relevance, or quality of AI-generated emoji suggestions
- You are responsible for reviewing and selecting appropriate emoji suggestions

### 3.2 Content Appropriateness

While we implement input sanitization and configure Google Gemini AI's content filtering measures, we cannot guarantee that all AI-generated content will be appropriate for all audiences. Content filtering is performed by Google Gemini AI's safety filters, and we are not responsible for content that these filters do not catch. You are responsible for:

- Reviewing emoji suggestions before use
- Ensuring content is appropriate for your intended use
- Not using inappropriate content in contexts where it may be harmful or offensive

### 3.3 Content Restrictions and Filtering

To maintain a safe and appropriate service, Emojify Text implements automated content filtering and restrictions. Content filtering is primarily performed by Google Gemini AI's built-in safety filters, which we configure to block inappropriate content. The App will block or reject text input that violates our content policy, including but not limited to:

- **Harassment:** Content that harasses, intimidates, or threatens others
- **Hate Speech:** Content that promotes hatred, discrimination, or violence against individuals or groups
- **Sexually Explicit Content:** Content that is sexually explicit or pornographic
- **Dangerous Content:** Content that promotes violence, self-harm, or illegal activities
- **Prompt Injection Attempts:** Attempts to manipulate or exploit the AI system through injection techniques

**Important:** Content filtering is performed by Google Gemini AI's safety filters. We configure these filters to block inappropriate content, but we are not responsible for content that Gemini's filters do not catch or for any inappropriate content that may pass through Gemini's filtering system. You are responsible for reviewing all AI-generated content before use.

If your input is blocked due to content policy violations, you will receive an error message indicating that the content violates our content policy. Please try different words or phrases. We reserve the right to reject any content that we determine violates our content policy or these Terms.

Additionally, the App enforces input validation measures on our backend including:

- Maximum input length limit of 1,000 characters to prevent abuse
- Input sanitization to remove null bytes, control characters (except newlines, tabs, and carriage returns), and normalize excessive whitespace
- Validation to detect and prevent prompt injection attacks using pattern matching and escape mechanisms
- UTF-8 character set validation to ensure valid encoding
- Response size limits: maximum 10 KB for JSON strings, 100 characters per emoji string, and 5 KB total response payload

## 4. User Responsibilities
